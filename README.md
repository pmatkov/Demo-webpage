## Demo website for class assignment

I have created a simple website using HTML and CSS for our class assignment. This is my first attempt at creating a website so it is far from perfect.

Before starting to work on the assignment I made a draft design of the page.

The requirements of the assignment were:
- create a five page website with mandatory pages *index*, *news*, *shop*, *contact* (in a subfolder) and *about us*
- use either float or positioning for the pages *index*, *contact* and *about us*
- create *news* with Bootstrap and *shop* with flexbox
- responsive design was required only for the navigation part of the website and the pages *news* and *shop* (wide and narrow layout)
- the choice of subject matter was free

Although not required by the assignment, I tried to make the website look as good as I could.
